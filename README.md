Overview
AuraX combines 40 sensors to monitor environmental and safety parameters. By collecting data on air quality, noise levels, soil quality, UV exposure, and more, AuraX provides a detailed and dynamic picture of environmental health. The system is equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities to allow for remote data transmission, enabling real-time monitoring from a web dashboard or mobile application.

Features
Comprehensive Environmental Data: Monitors air quality, temperature, humidity, noise levels, soil quality, UV index, and more.
Real-Time Alerts: Automated alerts for critical conditions (e.g., high CO₂ levels, hazardous gases, or extreme weather).
Remote Access: Data can be transmitted to a server for remote monitoring and historical data analysis.
Modular Sensor Management: Organized sensor groups for efficient data processing and maintenance.
Flexible Dashboard Integration: Compatible with web and mobile dashboards for visual data insights.
Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: Arduino MEGA 2560
Wi-Fi Module: ESP8266 or ESP32 for data transmission
Display: LCD or OLED for local monitoring
Multiplexer: 74HC4051 or similar for expanding input pins
Power Supply: External power source or solar panels (optional)
Sensors:
Air Quality: MQ135 (CO₂), PM2.5, PM10
Environmental: DHT22 (temperature, humidity), BMP085 (pressure)
Light and Sound: Sound sensors, light sensors, UV sensor
Soil Quality: Soil moisture, pH sensor, conductivity sensor
Safety: PIR motion sensors, vibration sensors
Weather Conditions: Rain sensor, wind speed and direction sensors
Refer to the hardware_config.md file for detailed wiring instructions.

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (v1.8.19 or later)
Arduino Libraries:
Adafruit_Sensor
DHT, BMP085, MQ135, SI1145 (for UV)
WiFi (ESP8266 or ESP32)
Additional sensor-specific libraries as per hardware requirements
Refer to libraries.md for links to required libraries.

Installation and Setup
Hardware Assembly:

Connect the sensors to the Arduino Mega using the specified pins. Refer to the hardware_config.md for details.
Connect the ESP8266/ESP32 Wi-Fi module for remote data transmission.
Software Setup:

Download and install the necessary libraries listed in the Software Requirements.
Clone this repository:
bash
Copia codice
git clone https://github.com/username/AuraX.git
Open AuraX.ino in the Arduino IDE, configure Wi-Fi credentials, and upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
Dashboard Setup (Optional):

Connect the system to a web dashboard for data visualization. Instructions for dashboard setup can be found in dashboard_instructions.md.
Usage
Once set up, AuraX will start collecting data from all 40 sensors and display real-time values on the local LCD or OLED display. Data is also transmitted via Wi-Fi to a remote server every 60 seconds for continuous monitoring. Critical alerts can be configured to trigger notifications if environmental parameters exceed safe thresholds.

Main Functions:

Data Collection: Periodically gathers data from sensors.
Data Transmission: Sends data to the server for remote analysis.
Alert System: Notifies the user in case of hazardous environmental conditions.
